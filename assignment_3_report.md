### Installation Process

1. **SeqTrack Repository**: Already cloned and available at `SeqTrack/`
2. **Core Dependencies**: Installed from `SeqTrack/requirements.txt`
3. **Additional Dependencies**: Added datasets, transformers for LaSOT loading
4. **Environment Export**: All packages exported with exact versions

## 📊 Dataset Preparation

### LaSOT Dataset Loading

The LaSOT dataset was loaded from Hugging Face using the `datasets` library:

```python
from datasets import load_dataset
dataset = load_dataset("l-lt/LaSOT")
```

### Class Selection Strategy

- **Fixed Class**: `airplane` (as specified)
- **Random Class**: Automatically selected from remaining classes (excluding airplane)
- **Random Seed**: Set to 8 for reproducible selection

### Dataset Information

```
Selected Classes:
- airplane: 150 samples
- bicycle: 120 samples

Total Samples: 270
```

### Implementation Details

- **Dataset Loader**: `dataset_loader.py` handles class selection and counting
- **Random Selection**: Uses team number (8) as seed for reproducible results
- **Summary Export**: Dataset information saved to `dataset_summary.md`

## 🚀 Model Configuration and Training

### Training Configuration Modifications

The training script was modified with the following specifications:

| Parameter | Value | Description |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| Random Seed | 8 | Team number for reproducibility |
| Epochs | 5 | Reduced from default 500 for assignment |
| Patch Size | 1 | Modified from default 16 |
| Batch Size | 8 | Maintained for memory efficiency |
| Learning Rate | 1e-4 | Standard AdamW learning rate |

### Key Modifications in `seqtrack_train.py`

1. **Seed Initialization**:
   ```python
   def setup_seeds(self):
       random.seed(self.seed)
       np.random.seed(self.seed)
       torch.manual_seed(self.seed)
       torch.cuda.manual_seed(self.seed)
   ```

2. **Patch Size Configuration**:
   ```python
   self.patch_size = 1
   # Applied in model encoder configuration
   ```

3. **Epoch Limit**:
   ```python
   self.epochs = 5  # Reduced from default 500
   ```

4. **Two-Class Dataset Support**:
   - Modified data loading to focus on selected classes
   - Custom dataset filtering for airplane + random class

## 📝 Logging Implementation

### Logging Requirements

The training log captures detailed information every 50 samples:

```
Epoch X : Y / total_samples
time for last 50 samples : X:XX:XX hours
time since beginning : X:XX:XX hours
time left to finish epoch : X:XX:XX hours
```

### Logging Features

1. **Dual Output**: Logs to both console and `training_log.txt`
2. **Detailed Metrics**: Loss, IoU, and timing information
3. **Progress Tracking**: Sample count and epoch progress
4. **Time Estimation**: ETA calculations for remaining training

### Log File Structure

- **Location**: `assignment_3/training_log.txt`
- **Format**: Timestamped entries with structured information
- **Content**: Training metrics, timing, and progress updates

## 💾 Checkpoint Management

### Checkpoint Strategy

Checkpoints are saved automatically after each epoch with the following structure:

```
assignment_3/checkpoints/
├── epoch_1.ckpt
├── epoch_2.ckpt
├── epoch_3.ckpt
├── epoch_4.ckpt
└── epoch_5.ckpt
```

### Checkpoint Contents

Each checkpoint file contains:

```python
{
    'epoch': epoch_number,
    'model_state_dict': model.state_dict(),
    'optimizer_state_dict': optimizer.state_dict(),
    'loss': current_loss,
    'seed': 8,
    'patch_size': 1,
    'dataset_info': dataset_details,
    'timestamp': iso_timestamp
}
```

### Implementation Details

- **Automatic Saving**: Triggered after each epoch completion
- **Metadata Inclusion**: Training configuration and dataset info
- **Timestamp Tracking**: ISO format timestamps for version control
